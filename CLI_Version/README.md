## Features Overview

### [1] Compress a Video
Compress a single video file to reduce its size with customizable compression levels. Choose from Low, Medium, or High compression based on your quality vs. size requirements. The tool provides detailed information after compression including original size, compressed size, size reduction percentage, and processing time.

### [2] Compress a Directory of Videos
Batch compress all videos within a specified directory. This feature generates a CSV file with detailed compression statistics for each video, including file sizes, remaining size percentage, and size reduction percentage. Perfect for processing multiple videos efficiently.

### [3] Compress an Image
Compress a single image file with three compression levels (Low, Medium, High) to balance quality and file size. After compression, you'll receive detailed information about the original size, compressed size, size reduction, and processing time.

### [4] Compress a Directory of Images
Batch compress all images within a specified directory. Similar to video batch compression, this feature generates a CSV file with comprehensive compression data for each image, making it easy to track compression results across multiple files.

### [5] Record Screen without Audio
Capture your screen activities without recording any audio. The recording duration is displayed when you stop the recording. This feature is useful for creating tutorials, presentations, or any screen-based demonstrations where audio isn't needed.

### [6] Save Output Path for Screen Recording
Set and save a custom output path for your screen recordings. This feature provides flexibility and organization, allowing users to choose where their screen recordings are stored by default.

### [7] Extract Audio from Video
Extract the audio track from any video file and save it as a standalone MP3 file. The tool displays the processing time after extraction. This is useful for users who want to isolate music, speeches, or any audio content from videos.

### [8] Convert Audio to Any Format
Convert audio files from one format to another, supporting various formats like MP3, WAV, AAC, FLAC, OGG, etc. You can convert single files or entire directories. Processing time is displayed after conversion.

### [9] Convert Image into Any Format
Convert image files from one format to another, supporting formats like JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, WEBP, etc. You can convert single files or entire directories. Processing time is displayed after conversion.

### [10] Trim Audio/Video
Trim audio or video files by specifying start and end times. This feature uses fast processing techniques to extract segments without re-encoding (where possible), preserving original quality.

## Enhanced User Experience Features

### Detailed Output Information
After each operation, the tool provides comprehensive information to help you understand the results:

- **File Size Information:** Original and compressed file sizes in KB
- **Compression Statistics:** Remaining size percentage and size reduction percentage
- **Processing Time:** Time taken for each operation in seconds
- **Output Paths:** Clear indication of where files are saved
- **Progress Updates:** Real-time progress for batch operations

### CSV Reports for Batch Operations
When compressing directories of videos or images, the tool automatically generates a `compression_data.csv` file containing:
- File name
- Original file size (KB)
- Compressed file size (KB)
- Remaining size percentage
- Size reduction percentage

This CSV file makes it easy to analyze compression results across multiple files and track optimization efforts.

### Automatic Folder Opening
After operations complete, the tool automatically opens the output folder in Windows Explorer (unless the output is on the Desktop), making it easy to access your processed files immediately.

### Robust Logging & Error Handling
The application now features a comprehensive logging system. All activities and errors are recorded in `app_debug.log` (created in the same directory), helping you troubleshoot issues. The tool is also protected against unexpected crashes, ensuring a smooth user experience even when errors occur.

### Smart FFmpeg Detection
No need for complex PATH configurations. The tool intelligently locates `ffmpeg.exe` whether it's in the system PATH, the current directory, or bundled within the application (PyInstaller compatibility), ensuring seamless execution.

### Compression Level Options
Both video and image compression offer three levels:
- **Low Compression:** Best quality, larger file size
- **Medium Compression:** Balanced quality and file size (default)
- **High Compression:** Smaller file size, lower quality

### Extension Flexibility
You can optionally change file extensions during compression, allowing you to convert formats while compressing (e.g., compress a video and change it from .avi to .mp4).
